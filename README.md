# unit-4-game

This game was created for Northwestern's Coding Bootcamp homework assignment #4 with a goal of creating an interactive web-based game. This time, the app must dynamically update the HTML with the jQuery library.

Instructions: There will be four crystals displayed and each has a random hidden value between 1 - 12. The game will reveal a random number at the start between 19 - 120.

When you click on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to your total score. To win, you will need to match the crystal score to the random number. You lose if your score goes above the random number.

The game will restart once you win or lose. Once a new game begins, the player should see a new random number and all the crystals will have four new hidden values.
